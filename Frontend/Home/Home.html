                <p>We at Sealerdip Dealership were founded in 1653 by a young entrepreneur (to the left) which decided, enough is enough, cars should be bought the same way they have, but the money should enter my bank account instead! He went on to found a multi-national, multi-billion, and completely real business selling cars online. It was a rough start at first, because people could not buy his cars as they were online and no one had internet in 1653, so Mr. Sealerdip himself decided to invent electricity, the internet, mobile devices, and cars; all to take the money of the people in the world.</p>

                <img src="../img/seal.webp" class="float-end">
                <p class="">The employees we hire are world class. They have masters and doctorate degrees in Business, Marketing, Finance, Psychology, Economics, and more. They must also take our own courses such as: How to take money 101, Gaslighting customers, Disguise a car in 3 easy steps, and more! To the right we have an average employee; hard working, motivated, focused on you, and most importantly: a seal. All company hires must either be a seal, have the ability to shapeshift into a seal for upwards of 6 hours, or have a masters degree in Disguise, Biology, and Seal Imitation.</p>
